        I was invited by Katrin Mayer to join in the investigation of her
        speculative question of what a feminist perspective on code might look
        like. We began collaboratively researching into internet history and
        were especially interested in thinking about where code came from, how
        it was made, how it looked and what it could look like. Code, computing
        and programming are of course inextricably linked to the history of
        technology and the people who operated it; turns out, they were women.
        Conditioned to think of computing as a predominantly male domain, we
        were fascinated to learn of its female origins thanks to excellent
        research done on this topic in recent years, and are excited to see how
        a feminist rewriting of computing history is well under way today.

          Computer has two separate yet related meanings. A computer, from the
          early 17th century and up until the first half of the 20th century,
          referred to “someone who computes.” It was a person whom, by hand,
          performed time-consuming and tedious mathematical calculations. As the
          work of such Computers was akin to secretarial work, it was often the
          work of women.

        Amongst the earliest technological innovations that would change the
        idea of what we now understand as “computing” was the Analytical Engine
        by Charles Babbage. He is widely credited as the inventor of the machine
        (the hardware, though a term coined much later) while his associate,
        mathematician and Computer Ada Lovelace, was the brilliant mind that
        conceived of its algorithms (what we now call software), left

          The Analytical Engine would never be completed, but it represents the
          conceptual dawn of the computer age. (...) the strikingly original
          notes that Ada prepared to explain this new kind of machine would
          presage the literature of computer science by nearly a century. To
          demonstrate how the engine could calculate Bernoulli Numbers without
          any assistance from a “human hand or head,” she wrote mathemathical
          proofs that many scholars characterize as the first computer programs

        But the Analytical Engine was yet too far ahead of its time, and while
        more efforts were made to invent technology that would aid in computing,
        data had to be processed and calculated painstakingly by hand. The
        fields of mathematics, astronomy and physics were dependant on the work
        of human Computers, many of them women. There was a widespread
        biologistical belief that the meticulousness and patience necessary to
        doing this kind of work were supposedly inherent “female” traits,
        “women’s work.” Though it enabled women to enter the workforce and
        strive toward some level of independence, the female prevalence in these
        jobs was in truth mostly due to the fact that they were paid much lower
        wages. It was when computing power was measured in “kilo girls”: 1000
        hours of (female) computing labour.

        In the beginning, typewriters did not differentiate between the widths
        of individual letters, and thus each letter was printed with the same
        width. This meant that some particularly wide letters (like the m and
        most uppercase letters) had to be squeezed to fit the space, and others
        (such as i, l, I) had to be modified to fill out more space, as to not
        cause too many gaps in the text.

        The necessary letter modifications resulted in a new genre of monospaced
        typefaces. They turned out to be particularly useful for clearly
        distinguishing letters, for writing data in an orderly manner, and for
        helping the eye compare lines and layout. All of this is still vital
        when writing and reading code, and so this choice of typeface has
        prevailed in programming until today. I began to think about the
        connections between text and code; letters and technology; between
        typing, writing and coding. But before algorithms were written, typed or
        punched, they were wired. It was women who were tasked with figuring out
        the machine; and by doing so, they invented software programming.

          wired the program by fixing cables and flicking the machine’s switches
          in the sequences they had developed. The positions of those switches
          and cables were the program. By training themselves to program the
          ENIAC, they invented and developed major computing concepts which are
          still widely used by programmers today, such as nested loops for
          example.

        After decades of suffering disregard, they have finally started to
        receive recognition in recent years. Punchcards, though not an entirely
        new technology, were adopted from around 1930 to write and store

        This type of data storage transmits data through holes and non-holes,

          Grace Murray Hopper was an American computer scientist known for
          popularizing the idea that programming languages could be independent
          from machines, and that an English-based language was possible. (...)
          She recalls: “(...) It’s much easier for most people to write an
          English statement than it is to use symbols. So I decided data
          processors ought to be able to write their programs in English, and
          the computers would translate them into machine code. (...) I would
          say ‘Subtract income tax from pay’ instead of trying to write that in
          octal code or using all kinds of symbols.”

        Programming today carries her legacy. First and foremost, code is a
        language, with syntax and grammar and vocabulary, plus some logic. We
        can invent code much like a sentence, choosing the words that fit best.
        Code is text both in the sense that it is composed by letters and that
        it can be written and read.
        <br />
        <br />
        When thinking about Hoppers legacy, language and the readabilitiy of
        code, one might ask: Who actually reads the code? In the case of this
        website, I write code for the browser to read, interpret, execute. The
        browser is my audience. And not only does it speak a different language,
        it has a wholly different way of reading. Did you know that spaces take
        browsers just the same time to read as actual letters? Every glyph typed
        – even if it is a blank space – results in information stored, and
        corresponds to storage space or file size. This is why proper
        programmers storetheircodewithoutspaces. The absence of a letter is not
        nothing, blank space not 0.
        <br />
        <br />
        The only humans reading the code I write is myself and possibly other
        coders working on it with me, who are likely already tuned into
        conventional abstractions and lazy shortcuts. Go to your favourite
        website, right click, inspect the code. Can you read what’s going on? We
        thought – but then how could code be written as humanly readable as
        possible, even for those who don’t code? Please right click right here
        and inspect this website’s code. Disclaimer: Writing code that is both
        functional to browsers and readable to humans leads to many inefficient
        workarounds and plenty of failure, because without keeping some symbolic
        and syntactical conventions, browsers would quite simply not understand.
        But maybe try it, climb all the way up, then travel down and go inside.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope it becomes clear how the code was written hand in hand with its
        design and named by its content; a conceptional attempt – ambitious and
        doomed – to place central emphasis on being able to navigate the website
        just based on its source code, even through the non-coder’s eye.
        <br />
        <br />
        The letters in code are data and thus stand purely for the information
        of which symbol is used. But this information is manifested as letters
        of a certain shape; they are not only read but seen, too. Every text
        needs a typeface. This text, this code, this website needed a typeface.

        Early typewriters usually came with one typeface built right into the
        machine. The introduction of changeable typefaces moved the typewriter
        one step closer to becoming a modern productive word processor and
        precursor of today’s desktop computers. The IBM Selectric, released in
        1961, was one of the first machines where fonts could be switched easily
        and characters could be stored on a magnetic band, making it thus an
        important bridge technology between typewriter and computer.

        >
          At the physical heart of the Selectric typewriter’s innovation was a
          golf-ball-shaped type head that replaced the conventional typewriter’s
          basket of type bars. The design eliminated the bane of rapid typing:
          jammed type bars. And with no bars to jam, typists’ speed and
          productivity soared.
          <br />
          <br />
          One other innovation in the design—a changeable typeface—was borrowed
          from a turn-of-the-century model, the Blickensderfer typewriter. (...)
          By making the golf ball interchangeable, the Selectric enabled
          different fonts, including italics, scientific notation and other
          languages, to be swapped in. With the addition in 1964 of a magnetic
          tape system for storing characters, the Magnetic Tape Selectric
          Typewriter (MT/ST) model became the first, albeit analog,
          word-processor device.
          <br />
          <br />
          Less well-known is the Selectric typewriter’s role as one of the first
          computer terminals. (...) A modified version of the Selectric, dubbed
          the IBM 2741 Terminal, was adapted to plug into the System/360, and
          enabled a wider range of engineers and researchers to begin talking to
          and interacting with their computers.

        Dual Basic was one of the many typefaces available for the Selectric. I
        liked the typeface for its openness and clarity; also, it lacks the
        usual modifications done on monospaced typefaces to fill visual holes.
        It is almost like a text typeface only with equalized widths; it seemed
        like an interesting in-between, unsure of which technology or age to
        belong to.I found that in my investigation into all this, the harder I
        looked, the blurrier the lines became between coding, writing and
        typing. Might the distinction between them be simply determined by my
        choice of typeface and machinery? For coding, I use a code editor and a
        monospaced font, because it is easier for reading text that is code. For
        writing, I use a proportionally spaced typeface, because it is easier
        for reading text that is not code. In both cases, I press buttons, I
        type.
        <br />
        <br />
        The typeface you are reading and seeing now is Coda, designed as part of
        this project. It is based on the framework of Dual Basic and modified in
        two directions: In one, whitespace is taken out, and the monospaced
        becomes proportional, much nicer for reading this text right now. In the
        other direction, fictional serifs are added, to transform it into a
        fully functional coding typeface.
        <br />
        <br />
        Every letter and every way a letter’s line is made, drawn, chiseled or
        printed has a historical and technological provenance. Today, typefaces
        are produced digitally; they are software, they are code, thus
        themselves written and composed of text. We can think about variables,
        interaction, output. Code is text is type is font is code?

          Something happened to the generation of programmers after Grace Hopper
          and her peers. Although (...) women were being encouraged to pursue
          programming as an alternative to secretarial work, the field was
          quickly becoming far less welcoming to women than it had been even a
          decade before. (...) Instead of running departments and advancing
          their art, they were starting to cluster “at the lower end of the
          occupational pool” (...).

        Let me tie at least one of many loose ends here. You may rightfully
        wonder: what happened to women programmers? Why is the image we have of
        a programmer today automatically, reflexively, that of a man? I have
        mentioned the wage discrimination that had been structurally present
        from the moment women entered the modern workforce. There was also an
        unwillingness by computer companies to provide models of work that would
        help to balance childcare with a career. And as computing developed into
        an increasingly important and profitable industry, the image, value and
        requirements of the profession changed profoundly. A conference held in
        1968 to address the so-called “software crisis” (a consequence of
        programming’s difficulty to keep up with ever accelerating technological
        progress) initiated a movement to re-brand programming as “software
        engineering.” What sounds like a merely semantic change would however
        come to have far-reaching implications, determining who could gain
        access to the field and who couldn’t.

          As such, it would be treated like a branch of engineering (...). This
          change signaled a larger renegotiation of computing’s professional
          status that would unfold through professional journals and societies,
          hiring practices, and certification programs throughout the 1960s and
          1970s. The more the discipline professionalized, the more it grew
          implicitly masculine. The introduction of formal educational
          prerequisites for programming jobs, for example, made it harder for
          self-taught programmers to find employment – a change that penalized
          female candidates, particularly those who might have taken time off
          from school to raise children, above all. If computing “began as
          women’s work,” writes historian Nathan Ensmenger, “it had to be made
          masculine.”

        Women faded from the profession. They were never truly gone, but harder
        to be found. There were still women where networks were formed;
        hypertexts created; knowledge organised; search engines built; message
        boards hosted; connections drawn... But the landscape of computing, and
        the idea of what it represents and how it’s represented, changed to such
        an extent that female contributions were in many parts forgotten. This
        is of course an incomplete history, told subjectively through the lens
        of Katrins and my research, the books we read, the course of our
        conversations, personal interests and own experiences. I never had or
        knew of female programmer role models. The suggestion to code my own
        website and not use Geocities for the homepage of my email writing club
        came from my stepfather, a software engineer, and sparked my fascination
        with what pure text can create. Though off to an early start,
        programming was never in the realm of what I considered for my
        professional future, because I simply never knew that someone like me
        could be doing something like that. It took me a long time to realize
        that if I wanted to see it, I needed to be it – or at least try to. I am
        happy to see more women, now; again. This research has been instrumental
        in discovering somewhat of a 1ineage.

        This is the structure of the web’s native tongue, a programming language
        called HTML. It is especially prone to endless fractal-like nesting of
        elements inside and alongside one another. Structures are built with a
        syntax that wraps, creates vessels, holds, embraces, stacks, plunges,
        births. Thus, web code knows words and concepts of inheritance and
        ancestry.
        <br />
        <br />
        :first-child, :nth-child(n), :last-child, children, childrenNodes,
        siblings(), nextSibling, parentNode, parent(), parents(),
        parentsUntil(), gparent(), just to name a few. This is what it looks
        like:
        <br />
        <br />
        Thankfully, we do not write code on empty sheets of paper anymore. We
        use code editors; fancy text programs that do all kinds of things to
        help find our way in the matrix. There, lines have proven to be the most
        efficient crumbs for finding back, connecting beginnings and ends.
        Looking at our digital interfaces, lines often signal traces back to an
        origin, to the first element, post, tweet or email.
        <br />
        <br />
        We were also reminded of the warps in fabrics, vertically structuring a
        textile piece that back in the day might have been programmed by
        punchcards, ancestors to the code written here. The lines you can see on
        this website visualise how the code of this website looks in the moment
        of coding it. Its design mirrors its code, shows the process, reveals
        its own making, in a way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lines have a way of accumulating the more we write, the deeper we dig
        and the longer we go. It means something is building: software,
        patterns, conversations, layers, story. These lines we can create
        ourselves; they make a structure that we can use to crawl in between
        hierarchies and chronologies; and they are the scaffold this website,
        this text, this story builds on.
